I have a strong passion for working with medical images, encompassing various aspects such as image processing, computer-aided diagnosis, and deep learning applications. I've previously worked on projects involving lung segmentation and Alzheimer's classification through handwriting analysis. Looking ahead, I'm eager to explore the realms of GANs and diffusion models, particularly in the context of generating synthetic medical images for training purposes. My goal is to leverage these techniques to contribute to advancements in the field of medical imaging.
