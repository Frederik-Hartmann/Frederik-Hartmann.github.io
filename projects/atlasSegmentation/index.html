A registration step was performed prior to the segmentation to register the atlas, i.e., the mean image, to the target.</p> <p align="center"> <img src="img/dataset.png" alt="Example of the different modalities of the dataset" width="400"> <br> <em>Fig.1.

The methodology encompassed various stages:</p> <ol> <li> <strong>Atlas Registration</strong>: Employing a multi-step registration process using rigid, affine, and multi-resolution b-spline registration.</li> <li> <strong>Segmentation Techniques</strong>: We experimented with segmentation using tissue models, probabilistic atlas, and combinations of both, with and without GMM. We also explored different GMM initialization methods and integration of the probabilistic atlas at various stages of the process.</li> </ol> <h2 id="results">Results</h2> <p>The effectiveness of the methods was evaluated using the Dice Score and Balanced Accuracy metrics. We found that the combination of tissue models and probabilistic atlas yielded the best results.

Our experiments revealed that combining these two methods significantly enhances the accuracy of segmentation, as evidenced by the improved dice scores. The standout finding was the superior performance of the tissue model, both as a standalone approach and when used in conjunction with the probabilistic atlas.</p> <p>Further, we observed that the timing of atlas integration plays a crucial role in the segmentation process. The integration of the probabilistic atlas post-GMM computation emerged as the most effective strategy, suggesting a nuanced interplay between atlas information and GMM initialization. These insights pave the way for more sophisticated approaches in medical imaging analysis.</p> <p>Moving forward, we aim to incorporate these findings into a deep learning framework. We believe that leveraging the strengths of both traditional and modern techniques will revolutionize the accuracy and efficiency of brain tissue segmentation. The potential for improved diagnostic tools and treatment strategies in neurology is immense, and our study marks a significant step toward realizing this goal.</p> </body></html>
