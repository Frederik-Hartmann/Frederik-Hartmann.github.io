abstract = {Working in front of the computer for long periods of time leads to exhaustion, fatigue and high strain on the eyes. Often the natural eye blink activity is disturbed and the eyes do not form enough tears to stay moist. Computer workstations are usually equipped with a webcam, making it convenient to monitor eye blinking and easy to perform blink interventions. In this paper, we present a blink detection method that uses 3D landmarks. After presenting existing publicly available blink databases, we evaluate the accuracy of our blink detection method and discuss the results. In addition, we illustrate the scope of our eye blink detection method in the application of a non-contact stress detection software to support stress reduction in the field of occupational health management.},
